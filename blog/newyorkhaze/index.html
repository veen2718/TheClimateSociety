            New Yorkers woke up this morning to a thick haze engulfing the city as smoke from
        wildfires in Canada spreads south through the country.
        New York City is experiencing some of the worst air pollution on earth due to the
        Canadian wildfires, making the Statue of Liberty and the famous skyline difficult to see
        even from close ranges. The Big Apple’s mayor has urged residents to stay indoors as
        the pollution has led to bad air quality not seen since the 1960s.
        The city’s air quality index spiked to 355 on Wednesday afternoon, much beyond the
        level of 100 that is thought to pose a threat to human health. Pregnant women and the
        elderly are vulnerable groups, but even healthy adults outside of these demographics
        might have breathing problems, throat discomfort, and watery eyes when exposed to air
        this polluted.
        <br><br>
        As of early Wednesday, The New York State Department of Environmental
        Conservation has issued an air quality advisory in place for a number of locations in
        New York state, with a number of those areas, including the metro New York City area
        and Long Island, being described as having air that is &quot;unhealthy for sensitive groups.&quot;
        The lower and upper Hudson Valley regions were among the other locations with
        &quot;moderate&quot; air quality levels. City officials have said they expect the advisory to remain
        in place for the next few days but added it’s particularly difficult to forecast smoke
        conditions.
        <br><br>
        While the smoke is projected to move away from New York in the following days, more
        widespread wildfires are anticipated in the months to come, with residents of the US
        West being the most severely affected by the smoke and the immediate threat of the
        flames.
        <br><br>
        Due to the smoke, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday suspended
        certain flights at LaGuardia Airport in New York. At Newark Liberty International Airport,
        delays were also being brought on by visibility.
        Due to worries about the quality of the air, New York City Public Schools announced
        late Tuesday that all of its schools will cancel outdoor activities.
        However, major sporting events are still taking place, including Tuesday’s game
        between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox which seemed to have
        been blanketed by a cloud of smoke in the Yankees Stadium.
        <br><br>
        New York is not alone in suffering from the fire, however. In Canada itself, with more
        than 400 active wildfires currently burning across nearly all Canadian provinces and
        territories the wildfires have displaced more than 20,000 people and scorched close to 4
        million Hectares of land. In a statement released by the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin
        Trudeau has said this is the worst wildfire season Canada has ever had.
        US President Joe Biden said on Twitter that more than 600 US firefighters and other
        personnel, along with equipment, had been deployed to Canada to help battle the
        blazes.
        <br><br>
        The smoke from the western flames has been seen billowing into Canada and
        spreading to the east, according to satellite imagery. PM2.5, the minuscule sooty
        particles released by burning trees and vegetation, may be easily transported across
        long distances by winds. When inhaled, these PM2.5 particles can penetrate the lungs
        and result in a number of health issues.
        <br><br>
        Forty-three-year-old lawyer Hugh Hill said his throat had been &quot;stinging&quot; from the
        harmful haze, which he likened to the smell of a wood-burning fire. Like many New
        Yorkers, he chose to cover his face while out walking his dog in Central Park, normally
        Manhattan&#39;s green lung. &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s psychological or physical, but I know there&#39;s
        some benefit to wearing a mask. Obviously, it&#39;s not going to prevent everything, but the
        dog has to be walked,&quot; he told AFP.
        <br><br>
        &quot;It smells like someone is doing a barbecue,&quot; said Nicha Suaittiyanon, a 30-year-old
        tourist to New York City from Thailand, who complained of &quot;watery and itchy&quot; eyes.
