            The Pacific Northwest was recently struck by an agonizing heatwave that lead to  unprecedented temperatures all along the Pacific Northwest. Cities such as Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver all surpassed temperatures above 40°C (104°F), which was accompanied with a drastic increase in heat related deaths with Vancouver having a 195% this weekend. Moreover, there was one city in particular that made headlines and that was the small town of Lytton in British Columbia, Canada. Lytton reached a high of a sweltering 49.6°C (121°F), which is almost 5 degrees warmer compared to the previous Canadian record of 45°C (set in 1937), and resulted in more than 1,000 people fleeing their homes as a fast-moving fire swiftly engulfed the community in flames. 
        <br><br>
        What caused this heatwave? Climate change. Several factors have conspired to keep a massive ridge of warm air parked over the Pacific Northwest over the past several days. Meteorologists call this effect a “heat dome” because the warm air is trapped in a circulation pattern that prevents cooler air from moving in. This year, an unseasonably dry spring in the region has served to amplify the high temperatures. With so little moisture in the environment, solar energy that might otherwise have gone into evaporating water has instead been making hot air even hotter. And while the giant weather system is gradually inching eastward, its movement has been slowed by a wavy pattern in the jet stream called an “omega block,” which has allowed temperatures to soar in the same locations each day with little or no relief at night. Western Canada is, on average, two degrees warmer than it was in the 1940s and that number is increasing every year. We will continue to see these extreme spikes in temperature and we will be hit even harder by even warmer temperatures.

        How do we cope with the heat? Well below are some suggestions on how to alleviate the heat at home or at the office:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Put your feet in a bucket of ice cold water</li>
            <li>Have a cold shower or bath</li>
            <li>Close your shades before the sun comes in (especially windows facing south and west)</li>
            <li>Go downstairs or down to the basement where it's cooler</li>
            <li>Turn off electronics and anything that uses electricity (including light)</li>
            <li>Have damp towels at hand as they can help you cool down</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated. Drinking lots of water helps your body maintain a healthy temperature</li>
        </ul>
